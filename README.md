Project Title: Nest Thermostat

Team Members:
- Christopher Donner
- Pryambudhi Cahyadi

Project Description:
The Nest Thermostat is one of the most popular home thermostats on the market today.
Users will be able to enter their personal information and address on our website.
This data will be, then, stored in our Firebase.
From this user input data, users will be able to do the followings:
- display weather data based on user.location value
- display ambient temperature and target temperature from the NEST thermostat
- increment or decrement the thermostat target temperature. This must be bound by the actual thermostat limits of min=9 and max=32
- chart out the historic data we pull from firebase

Sketch of Final Product: TBD

APIs to be Used:
- openweather API
- Nest API

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
- create the main html body
- create and test APIs
- send data from APIs to our Firebase
- retrieve data from our Firebase and display it on our website
